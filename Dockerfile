# FrankenPHP: Caddy with PHP embedded, so the container speaks HTTP directly on
# a port instead of FastCGI. That matters here — the host's nginx is a plain
# reverse proxy, and proxy_pass to an HTTP port avoids the php-fpm arrangement
# where the project must sit at an identical absolute path on both sides or
# every request 404s on SCRIPT_FILENAME.
#
# Classic mode, NOT Octane: laravel/octane is not in composer.json. Adding it
# would mean editing a dependency set owned by another repo, plus auditing the
# app for state that leaks between requests. If Octane is wanted later it is a
# one-line change in docker/entrypoint.sh.
